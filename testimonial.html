						I have made many good friends studying here. When I leave this centre, I will surely remember all the good times that I had at this centre."</h3>

					<h3 class="text">"I joined the IP Math class in Sec 2 after doing badly for my mid-year exams. He really helped me work on my foundations in Math and I practised <br/> a lot to prepare for the EOY. And we succeeded. I was really happy to get my first A for Math back then.
						Thereafter, I continued to do well throughout Sec 3 and Sec 4. The teachers at JJS Tuition Centre always made sure I was well prepared for each test and each exam.
						During my 2 years at VJC, And I achieved one of the highest scores in the school for my JC 2 mid-year exams. It was quite a personal achievement for myself.
						Glad I chose the right centre!"

						<h3 class="text">"When I joined John’s classes at the start of Secondary One, I was in the Integrated Programme track in my school, so it was challenging and tough for me at first. 
						I was struggling to cope with the pace and difficulty of lessons. However, with John’s help, I was able to turn things around and I started to improve. John was able to provide me with the necessary resources so I could understand concepts with ease. 
						I was also able to tackle advanced Mathematics problems and John also helped me with my schoolwork. I was able to keep up with the lessons in school and I even learnt ahead of the school syllabus."
